# Smell The Roses

## What is this?

This is an interactive map of the rose garden at Brooklyn Botanic Gardens.

## Why is this?

## Hit me with some fun facts!

957 cultivars!

5000+ individual blossoms!

XX acres -- making it one of the largest rose gardens in the world

XXX visitors every summer!

## What's the tech?

The back end is in Rails, the front end in React, all deployed on render.

### Why Rails?

First, for the education. Never built a full-fledged Rails app before.

Second, because it's the right tool for the job. Rails excels at managing an evolving data model, and making searches, transactions, updates really easy and fluid. A rose map is, after all, a modestly heavy CRUD app. Perfect fit for Rails!

### Why React?

Good frontend framework is good.

## Where'd your data come from?

From the grace and two feet of my colleagues at the Recurse Center!

## Is this, like, _official_ official?

Ha ha, not yet. But the day is young.

## Thank you to my helpers!
