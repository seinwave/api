## Why Colors

- As a user, I expect to see icons that roughly correspond with the color of the
  cutltivar i'm looking for -- helps me to find the rose i want

- As a user, I like to see designed accents and elements with the color of the
  cultivar I'm looking for -- helps me to understand the state of the application
  I'm in, and adds a sense of whimsy
